               <h2>The Value of Money</h2>
               <p>the idea that money received in the present is more valuable than the same sum in the future because of its potential to be invested and earn interest -- is one of the founding principles of Western finance.Let's say you lent your friend $2000. Would you rather he repaid you today, or tomorrow? The logical choice would be today, because you'll be able to use your money, and potential gains that come with it, sooner.</p> 
               <p>If you're going to part with your money for any period of time, you probably expect a larger sum returned to you than you started with. Whether you're lending or investing, the goal is to make a gain to compensate you for going without your money for awhile.

                Suppose your friend offers to repay you $2000 today or $2050 next year. You must consider whether you'd earn more than $50 over the next year by investing your money elsewhere before choosing to delay receiving payment. Other factors include your time preference (whether you need the money right now or can wait awhile to get it back) and whether you trust your friend to actually repay you -- another reason why money is worth more in the present: it may never materialize in the future. As the saying goes, "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."

               <h2>Genetically Modified Food (GMO Food)</h2>
               <p>The war between genetically modified food supporters, or rather – bribed entities and enslaved farmers without voice, and anti-GM activists, has been long and painful. That war is not a cultural issue but a common sense issue. How much meddling in our food is permissible and is it right one company holds potentially 90 per cent of all genetically modified seeds in the world? It is ok that employers of that same company keep switching between serving government posts and serving their company? Any guesses already what company we are talking about?</p> 
               <p>Unfortunately for the global community Monsanto is accomplishing their purpose. They currently own potentially 90% of the world’s patents for genetically modified food seeds including cotton, soybeans, corn, sugar beets and canola. Do we as humans really want companies such as BASF, Bayer, DuPont, Syngenta, and Dow meddling with our food? Well, to a large extent they already are. Monsanto, for example, is infamous for taking advantage of small farmers, and with the advent of MoU’s they are doing so with governmental license.</p>

               <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>
               <p>But if someone from 2100 could visit us now, how would we view them? Probably like the gods of mythology. They would command everything around them by wishing for it. They would have perfect and ageless bodies. And they would ride across the universe in magical chariots. In the past, we feared the gods of mythology. In the next 100 years, we will become them.</p> 
               <p>The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces, translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate reado
